### Phant is No Longer in Operation

Unfortunately Phant, our data-streaming service, is no longer in service
and has been discontinued. The system has reached capacity and, like a less-adventurous Cassini,
has plunged conclusively into a fiery and permanent retirement. There are several 
other maker-friendly, data-streaming services and/or IoT platforms available 
as alternatives. The three we recommend are Blynk, ThingSpeak, and Cayenne. 
You can read our [blog post on the topic](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2413)
for an overview and helpful links for each platform.

All secondary SparkFun repositories related to Phant have been [archived](https://github.com/blog/2460-archiving-repositories)
and pulled in as a subtree in the main [Phant GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/phant/tree/master/archived_PhantRepos).
